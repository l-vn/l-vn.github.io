	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>
		I am currently a postdoc researcher at the Universidad de O'Higgins (<a href="https://www.uoh.cl" target="_blank">UOH</a>) in Rancagua, funded by the Center for Mathematical Modeling (<a href="https://www.cmm.uchile.cl">CMM</a>) in Santiago de Chile, and I work on various problems in optimization and game theory.
	</p>
	<p>
		My PhD thesis, entitled "Design and Pricing of New Energy Services in a Competitive Environment", has been successfully defended on April 4, 2019. It has been written under the supervision of Luce Brotcorne in Lille (<a href="https://team.inria.fr/inocs/" target="_blank">Inocs team at Inria</a>), and Didier Aussel in Perpignan (<a href="https://www.promes.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">PROMES lab</a>). During the PhD, I tried to establish optimal electricity pricing strategies for demand-side management by creating and solving multi-level optimization models. I considered single-leader single-follower, single-leader multi-follower, and multi-leader multi-follower models.

	<p>
		Before that, I obtained a BSc and a MSc in Mathematics from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/" target="_blank">EPFL</a>).

		After a MSc in Mathematics obtained from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL</a>), I decided to go on with academic research and spent three months as a research intern at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (<a href="https://www.ethz.ch/">ETHZ</a>) in the <a href="https://disco.ethz.ch/">DISCO group</a>.

		Apart from research, I am a passionate tennis player, an enthusiastic reader, a lover of puns and a defender of Oxford commas.
