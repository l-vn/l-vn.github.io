	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>After a MSc in Mathematics obtained from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (<a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">EPFL</a>), I decided to go on with academic research and spent three months as a research intern at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (<a href="https://www.ethz.ch/">ETHZ</a>) in the <a href="https://disco.ethz.ch/">DISCO group</a>. Finally, I started a PhD in Operations Research in France in Lille (<a href="https://team.inria.fr/inocs/">Inocs team at Inria</a>) and Perpignan (<a href="https://www.promes.cnrs.fr/">PROMES lab</a>) under the supervision of Luce Brotcorne and Didier Aussel. </p>
	<p>The title of my PhD is "Design and Pricing of New Energy Services in a Competitive Environment". More precisely, I tried to establish optimal electricity pricing strategies for demand side management by creating and solving multi-level optimization models. I considered single-leader single-follower, single-leader multi-follower, and multi-leader multi-follower models. I am currently reuniting all my works into a single thesis.</p>
	<p>Apart from research, I am a passionate tennis player, an enthusiastic reader, a lover of puns and a defender of Oxford commas.</p>
