	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>After a MSc in Mathematics obtained from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), I decided to go on with academic research and spent three months as a research intern at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ) in the DISCO group. Finally, I started a PhD in Operations Research in France in Lille (Inocs team at Inria) and Perpignan (PROMES lab) under the supervision of Luce Brotcorne and Didier Aussel. </p>
	<p>My research subject consists in establishing optimal electricity pricing strategies for demand side management. To this purpose, bilevel programs are being used.</p>
