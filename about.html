	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>After a MSc in Mathematics obtained from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), I decided to go on with academic research and spent three months as a research intern at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ) in the DISCO group. Finally, I started a PhD in Operations Research in France in Lille (<a href="https://team.inria.fr/inocs/">Inocs team at Inria</a>) and Perpignan (<a href="https://www.promes.cnrs.fr/">PROMES lab</a>) under the supervision of Luce Brotcorne and Didier Aussel. </p>
	<p>The title of my PhD is "Design and Pricing of New Energy Services in a Competitive Environment". More precisely, I try to establish optimal electricity pricing strategies for demand side management by creating multi-level optimization models. Until now, I considered single-leader single-follower and single-leader multi-follower models. I intend to switch to multi-leader multi-follower models in a soon future.</p>
	<p>Apart from research, I am a passionate tennis player, an enthusiastic reader, a lover of puns and a defender of Oxford commas.</p>
